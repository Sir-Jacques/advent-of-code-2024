This repository contains solutions for the Advent of Code challenges.

## Project Structure

- `day1/`: Contains the solution for Day 1.
- `template/`: Contains a template for new days.
- `day2/`: Contains the solution for Day 2.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.22.4 or later

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aoc.git
    cd aoc
    ```

2. Navigate to the desired day's directory:
    ```sh
    cd day1
    ```

3. Setup input file based on *your* input:
    ```sh
    vim input.txt
    ```

4. Run the solution:
    ```sh
    go run main.go
    ```

## Input Files

Each day's solution expects an `input.txt` file in the same directory. The input file should contain the challenge input data.

## Template

The `template/` directory contains a basic template to start a new day's solution. Copy the contents of this directory to a new directory for each new day.
